# Script: Ops 401 Class 13 script
# Author: Paul Stroud
# Date of latest revision: 05/03/23
# Purpose: Network Scanner pt3
# Resources used: Alex White, google, stackoverflow, github demo, chatgpt

# MAIN REQS:
# Objectives
# The final iteration of your network scanning tool will perform the following:

# Ping an IP address determined by the user.
# If the host exists, scan its ports and determine if any are open.
# Tasks
# Hereâ€™s a general outline of how to achieve the desired outcome.

# In Python, combine the two modes (port and ping) of your network scanner script.
# Eliminate the choice of mode selection.
# Continue to prompt the user for an IP address to target.
# Move port scan to its own function.
# Call the port scan function if the host is responsive to ICMP echo requests.
# Print the output to the screen.

# OPTIONAL REQS: (aka Stretch Goals)
# Instead of targeting a single IP address, allow the user to specify a range of IPs and have the tool scan each one in succession.
